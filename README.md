Moon Dog Technologies Software Repository
===========================
The Moon Dog Technologies Consortium was the dream of one man, and now that of several dozen citizens of Kerbin.

Herein you will find a full featured suite of navigational software built in the [kOS](https://KSP-KOS.github.io/KOS) framework, and features and utilities to accompany the instructional videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXrQZx4C1a3GPn7DXkyWhfw).

For more information, be sure to check out the [wiki](https://github.com/cptMoonDog/moon-dog-technologies/wiki).
